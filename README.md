# Mechanistic Analysis of Odorant Antagonism in Drosophila Or56a

Mechanistic analysis of odorant antagonism in *Drosophila melanogaster* olfactory receptor Or56a via docking and structural modeling.

This project explores how the agonist **geosmin** and antagonist **linalool** interact with Or56a, using a combination of **AlphaFold-based structure prediction**, **fpocket pocket identification**, **AutoDock Vina docking**, and **PyMOL structural alignment** to understand binding mode diversity and propose a mechanistic hypothesis for antagonism.
